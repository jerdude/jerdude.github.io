**Entry-Level QA Test Form**

Your challenge here is simple! A developer has completed a "PBI" (product backlog item) to create a new form. The PBI can be found below. Your task is to test the form. We're looking for two things here:

1. We'd like you to document each case you test for.
2. Once you find a bug, we want you to write up a brief description of what the bug was and how it can be recreated.

**The PBI:**

We need a form for a user to submit their name, email, a start date, an end date, a very short story, their favorite color, and their favorite number. Name and email will be required.

Acceptance criteria:
- The user should not be able to submit the form without all required fields having a value.
- The user should not be able to submit the form if they've provided improperly formatted inputs.
- When the user successfully submits the form, they should arrive at a new page that says "Success!!!".

HINT: There are at least 5 bugs on this form and not all are covered by the acceptance criteria.
